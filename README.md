# üéì Campus Network Design using Cisco Packet Tracer

This project demonstrates the design and simulation of a **Campus Network** using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The objective is to provide a scalable, secure, and efficient networking environment that supports communication between departments, internet access, and resource sharing within a campus.

# Project Overview

- **Tool Used**: Cisco Packet Tracer  
- **Network Type**: Campus Network  
- **Topology**: Hierarchical (Core, Distribution, and Access Layers)  
- **Devices Used**: Routers, Switches, PCs, Servers, Wireless Devices, etc.  
- **Protocol**: Static Routing / VLANs / DHCP / DNS (as per design)

##  Features Implemented

- ‚úîÔ∏è Logical and Physical Topology Design  
- ‚úîÔ∏è IP Addressing Scheme and Subnetting  
- ‚úîÔ∏è VLAN Configuration (for Departmental Isolation)  
- ‚úîÔ∏è Inter-VLAN Routing  
- ‚úîÔ∏è DHCP for Automatic IP Assignment  
- ‚úîÔ∏è DNS & Web Server Setup  
- ‚úîÔ∏è Wireless Network Setup  
- ‚úîÔ∏è End-to-End Connectivity Testing (ping, web access)

##  Network Topology

A hierarchical model with:

- **Core Layer**: Main router handling internet access  
- **Distribution Layer**: Layer-3 Switches separating departments  
- **Access Layer**: Switches connecting end devices (PCs, Printers, etc.)

---

##  Testing and Verification

-  Ping between VLANs  
-  Web server access from client machines  
-  DNS name resolution  
-  DHCP address allocation verified
